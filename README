Sleep my PC -  an application that turns off the computer when the user is inactive.

The application has easy to configure and includes features:
- Support for event type when idle: shutdown, reboot, logout and hibernation
- Remaining time when the user will be warned about the shutdown event
- The time interval when the program begins to monitor the inactivity of the user
- Shutdown event logging

The userâ€™s inaction is determined when he stops using keyboard or mouse devices.


How to use, settings:

- [Action]. The type of event that will be executed when the user is inactive.
